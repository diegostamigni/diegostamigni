### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Diego Stamigni
I am a softare engineer from Italy, currently living in London, UK. My main area of expertise are backend development and iOS app development.

Welcome to my profile! Please check out some of my work:
 * .NET [validation SDK](https://github.com/diegostamigni/Validator)
 * .NET [mediator SDK](https://github.com/diegostamigni/CommandExecutor)
 * A saga orchestrator for .NET [SagaOrchestrator](https://github.com/diegostamigni/Concerto.NET)

Throught my years of working I had to sometimes wrap REST API calls of third parties integrators that didn't provide .NET SDKs. Here are some of my implementations I use to this day:
 * [CHANGE (getchangeio) REST API](https://github.com/diegostamigni/Rest.GetChangeio)
 * [CometChat REST API](https://github.com/diegostamigni/Rest.CometChat)
 * [Crypto.com Merchant REST API](https://github.com/diegostamigni/Rest.CryptoCom.Merchant)

Some other projects I worked on which I'm proud of that I think are worth mentioning:
 * [RTMPKit](https://github.com/diegostamigni/RtmpKit)
 * [MvvmKit](https://github.com/diegostamigni/MvvmKit)
